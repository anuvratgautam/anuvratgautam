# 👋 Hi, I'm Anuvrat Gautam

**AI/ML Enthusiast | Full-Stack Developer | Data Pipeline Builder**

I design and build intelligent, data-driven applications that combine **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **full-stack development**. My work often involves **Transformers**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Vector Databases**—from concept to deployment.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build **context-aware AI systems** using Transformers, RAG, and semantic search.
- Deploy **Hugging Face models** and run **local LLMs with Ollama** for privacy-focused AI.
- Develop **full-stack dashboards** (MERN stack) for ML-powered analytics.
- Create **web scrapers and ETL pipelines** that handle large-scale, multi-source data.
